##  Day 3 â€” July 30, 2025: What I Learned

Today, I deepened my understanding of the **Bootstrap 5 framework** by practically applying it in a responsive, multi-section web page. Here's a breakdown of the concepts and utilities I worked with:

###  Concepts & Skills Learned

- **Bootstrap Navbar**
  - Built a responsive `navbar` with `navbar-expand-md` and `collapse` behavior.
  - Styled a left-aligned logo using only `.navbar` utility classes.
  - Used `justify-content-end` to align navigation buttons right.

- **Responsive Layout with Grid System**
  - Applied Bootstrapâ€™s 12-column grid with combinations `.
  - Aligned text responsively `.

- **Responsive Display Utilities**
  - Used `d-md-none` to hide components on medium screens and above, and `d-md-table` to reveal tables only on medium screens and above.

- **Tables and Width Control**
  - Centered the table on medium and above screens `.
  - Restricted table width with utility classes and inline `.

- **Forms & Inputs**
  - Built a complete form with fields for name, email, phone, position, file upload, and cover letter.
  - Used bootstrap's `form-control`, `form-label`, and `form-text` to maintain form consistency and accessibility.
  - I noticed that missing `form-control` can break width/responsiveness, especially for `textarea`.

- **Utility-First Styling**
  - Employed Bootstrap utility classes like `mt-5`, `px-4`, `mb-3`, `text-center`, and `btn btn-primary`.
  - Adjusted visual layout with no need for custom CSS thanks to Bootstrap utilities.

### ðŸ§  Key Takeaways

- Bootstrapâ€™s grid and utility classes speed up layout and design.
- Responsive breakpoints like `d-md-none` and `d-md-flex` help tailor content to different screen sizes.
- Tables and forms need `form-control` for full-width behavior.
- Most layout and alignment issues can be solved with utility classesâ€”custom CSS is rarely needed.
- Inline styles are acceptable for quick tweaks, but cleaner solutions exist using classes.
